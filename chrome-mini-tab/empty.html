<p>
I write almost everything important in my life:<br>
    thoughts, plans, notes, diaries, correspondence, code, articles, and entire books.
</p>

<p>
They are my extended memory — my noted self — my organized thoughts.<br>
I refer to them often.<br>
I search them, update them, and learn from them.
</p>

<p>
My written words are my most precious asset.<br>
They are also a history of my life.
